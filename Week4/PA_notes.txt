1. 目标是增加一些基于map的交互功能。
When hovers over a city marker, your map will display a box with the city’s name, country, and population. 
When hovers over an earthquake marker, your map will display the title of the earthquake (including its magnitude and
region).

A click on a city marker will lead to only that city and earthquakes which affect it being displayed on the map. 
Clicking once again on that marker will bring the rest of the map’s markers back.
Clicking on an earthquake marker, only cities potentially affected by that earthquake will be displayed.
